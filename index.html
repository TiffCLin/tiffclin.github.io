			<p>Hi there! I’m Tiffany. By day, I’m a research associate and project manager working at the intersections of technology, law, and policy. At the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, I tackle issues spanning digital security, to artificial intelligence, to online platform responsibility. I work on research and coordination on our cybersecurity projects and I am the project manager of Assembly, a Berkman Klein Center program operated in partnership with the MIT Media Lab.</p>
			
			<p>My passion is in working at the intersection of theory and practical action. I like to look for opportunities to implement unique ideas in the real world. I am extremely passionate about design, both at a systems level and in terms of visual implementations. Last year, I had the opportunity to create the design and web implementations of Catalysts for Collaboration, a tool for practitioners working on strategic litigation in the human rights context.</p>
			
			<p>I graduated from Knowledge Integration program at the University of Waterloo in Canada, where I specialized in sociology and collaborative design. My honors thesis focused on how the media covers controversial technologies, using Tor as a case study. My final collaborative design project analyzed and implemented ways to digitally connect readers to Canadian literature. In my spare time, I love to work on graphic design, illustrations, and photography. I also enjoy traveling and reading short stories.</p>
