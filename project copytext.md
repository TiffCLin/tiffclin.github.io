<h2>Satellite in the Shed: DIY Culture</h2>
<em>September 2012 - March 2013</em>
<p>Satellite in the Shed was a museum exhibit project that a team of us designed and constructed for the KI-X 2013 museum exhibition. In the Fall and Winter term of 2012-2013, I had a chance to work with <a href="http://twitter.com/ehellinga">Evaleen</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pwlast">Peter</a>, and <a href="http://">Jon</a> to work through the design process in order to create a museum exhibition that would be on display alongside the other team's exhibits. We went through interations of brainstorming relevant topics, planning the exhibit and writing copy, prototyping and eventually creating the objects, and ultimately creating the exhibition. </p>
